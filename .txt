We can now dive into our pages and manipulate them with JavaScript! We have many ways to do this, so we better keep them straight in our heads.

 

REMEMBER TO COMMENT YOUR CODE

 

Setup a GitHub repository and local git repository
The local repository should be a project created by the projectStarter script
Setup the index.html to link to your app.js
Add some simple content in your HTML (this can be anything) with some classes and id's
In you app.js show your knowledge of each of the following selectors:
querySelector()
querySelectorAll()
getElementById()
getElementsByClassName()
You must show each method by changing the page somehow! Not simply console.log anymore. You must demonstrate each of the following changes at least once:
Changing an elements style
Adding new content to a tag using innerHTML
Adding a new nested tag using innerHTML
Adding a new tag before an existing tag using outerHTML
Changing a tag completely using outerHTML
Add, commit and push to GitHub your changes and submit the GitHub URL.

Make sure you understand the difference between a DOM selector that returns multiple elements and one that only returns a single value. For ones that return multiple, you will want to loop through the results.

ex:

let comments = getElementsByClass(`comment`);

for(let i=0; i<comments.length; i++) {
  comments[i][`style`][`color`] = '#ff0000';
}
